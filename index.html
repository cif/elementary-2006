<strong>Updates</strong><br/><br/>
<em>May 25th 2006</em> - Drag and Drop folder management now works in IE, still have to clean up the hander building routine, as it lags a bit post drop.<br/><br/> 

<em>May 10th 2006</em> - I've taken drag and drop to the next level with ghost.js, and found some really cool applications for it
which I am currently working on implementing in a few projects. IE bugs are holding me up. Check back soon.<br/><br/> 

<em>Feb 18th 2006</em> - I finaly finished the drag and drop list functionality. First implementation
will be sorting items in a CMS- I'll probably work on a multi-tier list next. <br/><br/>
