# Elementary JS (ca 2006)

This is an archive of a very old JS library I wrote and used for web site and appliaction production prior to jquery becoming mainstream. 

Big credit to web.archive.org for holding onto this, otherwise I'd have lost it forever. 

It has been re-organized to work as a demo.
